- Cleaned the weather data of Szeged from errors using Pandas Dataframe
- Explored relationships betweeen the weather variables using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Utilized Scikit-Learn to connduct linear regression to predict apparent temperature 

## 2. [Conversion Rate](https://github.com/SubhankarHalder/Projects/blob/master/Conversion%20Rate.ipynb)

- Employed Pandas Dataframe to investigate the conversion rate of users visiting a website 
- Graphed plots between the converted users versus their ages, geographical location and source channel 
- Applied Scikit-Learn's logistic regression library to predict the conversion rate of the website's visitors

## 3. [Employee Retention](https://github.com/SubhankarHalder/Projects/blob/master/Employee%20Retention.ipynb)

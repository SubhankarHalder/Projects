# GITHUB's Issue With Rendering Jupyter Notebooks
It seems Github has an ongoing issue with rendering Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files). See https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3555

# If you cannot open my files on Github, please follow the following instructions to view my Jupyter Notebooks:
1. Go to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org
2. Paste the link of my file in the white box. For example, paste https://github.com/SubhankarHalder/Projects/blob/master/WeatherAnalysis.ipynb 
to view the Weather Analysis file
3. Click Go. 

# Machine Learning Projects

## 1. [Sale Price Prediction of Bulldozers](https://github.com/SubhankarHalder/Projects/blob/master/Blue%20Book%20for%20Bulldozers%20Sale%20Price.ipynb)
[![Screen-Shot-2019-11-11-at-11-00-07-AM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/JhpjXnCL/Screen-Shot-2019-11-11-at-11-00-07-AM.png)](https://postimg.cc/zLRLZqft)

- Employed Pandas DataFrame to clean and feature engineer data
- Used Scikit-Learn library to deploy Random Forest algorithm to predict logarithm of sale price 
- Tune Hyperparameters in the algorithm to adjust and reduce prediction error

## 2. [Weather Analysis](https://github.com/SubhankarHalder/Projects/blob/master/WeatherAnalysis.ipynb)

- Cleaned the weather data of Szeged from errors using Pandas Dataframe
- Explored relationships betweeen the weather variables using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Utilized Scikit-Learn to connduct linear regression to predict apparent temperature 

## 3. [Conversion Rate](https://github.com/SubhankarHalder/Projects/blob/master/Conversion%20Rate.ipynb)
[![Screen-Shot-2019-10-14-at-12-29-48-AM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/xTWLrnzP/Screen-Shot-2019-10-14-at-12-29-48-AM.png)](https://postimg.cc/vct4fRX1)
- Employed Pandas Dataframe to investigate the conversion rate of users visiting a website 
- Graphed plots between the converted users versus their ages, geographical location and source channel 
- Applied Scikit-Learn's logistic regression library to predict the conversion rate of the website's visitors

## 4. [Employee Retention](https://github.com/SubhankarHalder/Projects/blob/master/Employee%20Retention.ipynb)
[![Screen-Shot-2019-10-14-at-12-27-53-AM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/N0xXrXPN/Screen-Shot-2019-10-14-at-12-27-53-AM.png)](https://postimg.cc/B8Xbrj3D)
- Investigated employee join and quit data from various companies to predict when employees quit
- Exploited descriptive statistics and histograms to note when the employees quit

# Dashboard Report Project
